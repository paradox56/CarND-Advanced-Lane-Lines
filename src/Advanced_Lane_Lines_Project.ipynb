    "# Camera Calibration\n",
    "Each lens has its unique lens distortion based on its parameters. The monst common distortions include radial distortion and tangential distortion. Since we will be using camera to track lane lines, as well as determine curvature of the road, it becomes critical for us to remove these optical distortions. Based on the documentiaton from OpenCV (https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html) The radial distortion can be modeled with the following function:<br />\n",
    "$$x_{rad distort} = x(1+k_1r^2+k_2r^4+k_3r^6)$$ <br />\n",
    "$$y_{rad distort} = y(1+k_1r^2+k_2r^4+k_3r^6)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the tangential distortion is modeled as the following: <br />\n",
    "$$x_{tan distort} = x+[2p_1xy+p_2(r^2+2x^2)]$$ <br />\n",
    "$$y_{tan distort} = y+[p_1(r^2+2y^2)+2p_2xy]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can define the distortion coefficients $d$ as: <br />\n",
    "$$d = [k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2, k_3]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera matrix is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{C} = \\left[\\begin{array}\n",
    "{rrr}\n",
    "f_x & 2 & c_x \\\\\n",
    "0 & f_y & c_y \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $f_x, f_y$ is the focal length of the camera lens and $c_x, c_y$ is the optical center. To optain camera matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ and distortion coefficient $d$, we can utilize cv2.calibrateCamera( ) function from OpenCV.\n"

    "## Color Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thresoholding techqniue is used in color space. Intuitively, we want to extract the color of interest from the image that resembles the lane line (In this case, yellow and white colors) The standard RGB color space is a three dimensional vector space with Red, Green and Blue for each axis. In theory, we can directly perform color thresholding in RGB color space. However, the surrounding light can change dramatically in real-life situation, which can lead to poor performance and various of other issues. Alternatively, we can represent an image in Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) color space or Hue, Lightness and Saturation (HLS) color space. Why do we want to perform color thresholding in those color spaces? Well, the use of Hue and Saturation are critical because they are indepentdent of brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project, I decide to use HLS color space for color thresholding. To convert the image from RGB to HLS, I use the OpenCV function cv2.cvtColor(im, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HLS). After some testings, the saturation channel (S channel) performs the best in terms of extracting lane line, but I will combine it with Hue thresholding to get more degree of freedom. The following code demonstrate how a binary image is generated through S and H channel thresholding. "
